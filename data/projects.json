        "description": "In this project, we developed an automatic device to improve the quality of crop cultivation in lowland areas such as urban environments, with automated plant control using temperature and humidity sensors. The system development followed a prototype model approach, aiming to refine the design into a final system while saving time. In this case, the device was designed to detect soil temperature and moisture levels, which are regulated to remain within optimal ranges. The system responds automatically when there is a deficiency or excess in soil temperature or moisture, providing both a notification and an automatic watering action as output.",

        "role": "Hardware Designer & Electronics Development",
        "description": "The development of a blind spot detection system based on the Arduino Uno microcontroller is considered a suitable technology due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This system functions by providing early warnings to the driver through an LCD display, LED indicators, and a buzzer, all connected to sensors and the microcontroller. The importance of such a system lies in its ability to help prevent road accidents by alerting the driver to potential hazards in the vehicle’s blind spot. The system utilizes serial communication and several supporting components, including the Ultrasonic SRF04 sensor for object or vehicle detection, infrared sensors for transmitting data from the SRF04, the Arduino Uno microcontroller for data processing, and output components such as LEDs, a buzzer, and a monitor to indicate the presence of objects in the blind spot area. These elements work together to provide information and alerts to the driver, aiming to reduce the risk of accidents caused by blind spots.",

        "description": "ASRS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System) is one of the modern automation applications that is highly relevant in the industrial sector. The purpose of designing this ASRS is to replace manual methods in the storage and retrieval process, which are often time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human error. In this project, a mini ASRS system was designed and developed based on a microcontroller and PLC, capable of performing automatic storage and retrieval of goods. The system consists of several main components, including a Haiwell PLC, which serves as the main controller for managing the system’s logic; 3-axis stepper motors, which function as actuators to move the system vertically and horizontally; and an RFID sensor, which is used for item identification.",
